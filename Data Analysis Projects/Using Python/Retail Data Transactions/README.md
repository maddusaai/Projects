# Retail Data Transaction Analysis

This directory contains a data analysis project focused on retail transactions and customer response to a campaign. 

The data provides customer and date-level transactions for a few years. It can be used for demonstration of any analysis that requires    transaction information like RFM. The data also provide response information of customers to a promotion campaign.

The analysis involves working with two datasets:

1. **Retail Data Transactions**: This dataset includes information on retail transactions.
   
   - `customer_id`: A unique identifier for each customer who made a transaction.
   - `trans_date`: The date when the transaction occurred.
   - `trans_amount`: The amount of purchase made in each transaction.

2. **Retail Data Response**: This dataset provides information on customer response to a campaign.
   
   - `customer_id`: A unique identifier for each customer who made a transaction (same as in the Retail Data Transactions dataset).
   - `response`: A binary variable indicating whether the customer responded to the campaign or not.

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior and response to the campaign. By analyzing the transactional data and customer response data, we aim to understand patterns, trends, and factors influencing customer behavior and campaign response.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the datasets to ensure data cleanliness and compatibility for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploring the data to understand its structure, distributions, and relationships.
3. **Analysis of Transaction Data**: Analyzing transactional patterns such as purchase frequency, transaction amounts, and trends over time.
4. **Customer Response Analysis**: Investigating factors influencing customer response to the campaign, such as demographics or transaction history.

**Happy analyzing!**
